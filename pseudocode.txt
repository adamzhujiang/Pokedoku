How the initial game state should be initialized, with corresponding functions to represent the state of the game upon start

The X and Y axis categories should be randomized

The board should be blank

PP should be at 9/9

The game should be initialized properly upon page load

Define how the game is won or lost as the user plays the game using required constants

Define how the game works as players click on the squares in order to make selections. Will likely need a function to handle the click, and if possible provide a drop down of options for them to click on

Define a function for the game to cross check whether a selection is correct or not against the canonical data

Create a “Give Up” functionality 

Create a “Randomize” functionality
